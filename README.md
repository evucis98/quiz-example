**Managing locales:**

We're currently using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). Boilerplate
includes a working locale demo with language change handler.

Changing language is easy:

```
import { locale } from 'src/utils/locale';

const languageHandler = (lang) => {
    locale.changeLanguage(lang);
}
```

Locale config can be found in `src/utils/locale/`. Language files are located at `src/assets/locale/`.
